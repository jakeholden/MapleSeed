# MapleSeed
All work done to simulate the flow about a maple seed in autorotation and analyze it as a wind turbine.

## Abstract
Descending maple seeds generate lift to slow their fall and remain aloft in a blowing wind;
have the wings of these seeds evolved to descend as slowly as possible? A unique energy
balance equation, experimental data, and computational fluid dynamics simulations have
all been developed to explore this question from a turbomachinery perspective. The computational
fluid dynamics in this work is the first to be performed in the relative reference
frame.

Maple seed performance has been analyzed for the first time based on principles of wind
turbine analysis. Application of the Betz Limit and one-dimensional momentum theory
allowed for empirical and computational power and thrust coefficients to be computed for
maple seeds. It has been determined that the investigated species of maple seeds perform
near the Betz limit for power conversion and thrust coefficient. The power coefficient for a
maple seed is found to be in the range of 48 - 54% and the thrust coefficient in the range of 66 - 84%. From Betz theory, the stream tube area expansion of the maple seed is necessary for
power extraction. Further investigation of computational solutions and mechanical analysis
find three key reasons for high maple seed performance. First, the area expansion is driven
by maple seed lift generation changing the fluid momentum and requiring area to increase.
Second, radial flow along the seed surface is promoted by a sustained leading edge vortex
that centrifuges low momentum fluid outward. Finally, the area expansion is also driven by
the spanwise area variation of the maple seed imparting a radial force on the flow.

These mechanisms result in a highly effective device for the purpose of seed dispersal.
However, the maple seed also provides insight into fundamental questions about how turbines
can most effectively change the momentum of moving fluids in order to extract useful power
or dissipate kinetic energy.
